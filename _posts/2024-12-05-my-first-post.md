Welcome to my totally awesome homepage! I just learned HTML and I'm super excited to share my thoughts with the entire Internet. This is like having my own TV channel but better!

I spent all weekend learning how to make this page. My friend Dave showed me how to use Netscape Composer and it's pretty rad. Can't wait to add more cool stuff like animated GIFs and maybe even a Java applet!

**Update:** Now I'm using Jekyll and GitHub Pages! The future is now!
