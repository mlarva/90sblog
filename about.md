## All About Me!

**a/s/l:** 18/m/cali

**Interests** Sports, beaches, The Sign 

**Occupation:** Professional Internet Explorer (the activity, not the browser!)

### My Interests:
- Surfing the Information Superhighway
- Learning HTML and maybe some of that fancy JavaScript stuff
- Collecting animated GIFs
- Playing Doom via email
- Waiting for web pages to load on my 28.8k modem
- IRC chatting on #cool-people

### My Computer Setup:
I'm running a totally awesome Pentium 90MHz with 8MB of RAM and a massive 1GB hard drive! My setup includes:
- Windows 95 (upgraded from DOS 6.22)
- Netscape Navigator 3.0
- A blazing fast 28.8k modem
- SoundBlaster 16 for those sweet MIDI files
- A 15" CRT monitor that only weighs 40 pounds!

### Why I Started This Blog:
I wanted to have my own little corner of the World Wide Web where I could share my thoughts and connect with other Internet enthusiasts. The future is digital, and I want to be part of it!

Feel free to drop me a line at my email address: webmaster@myisp.net (please be patient, I only check email twice a day when I dial up to the Internet)
